It&amp;rsquo;s our job to take these recordings and to make them sound like what people think guns sound like. More exciting and explosive, instead of pops like firecrackers.
We can break the sound down into the following elements transient, body, thump, tail, foley or mechanical sounds, and bullet/shells.</description></item><item><title>Game Sound Database</title><link>/pages/database/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/database/</guid><description/></item><item><title>intro to unity</title><link>/pages/lectures/week-2-the-roll-of-audio-in-interactive-and-immersive-environments/wednesday-9-1/intro-to-unity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/lectures/week-2-the-roll-of-audio-in-interactive-and-immersive-environments/wednesday-9-1/intro-to-unity/</guid><description>Start with a new scene
