## Project 1

Add sounds to 5 GameObjects in pyramid tutorial project. Move them with the scripts you already had and listen to how the doppler effect works.

## Project 2

Use sounds freesound.org to replace the sounds of the FPS project. You may need to edit the sounds from freesound, or manipulate them. Experiment with filters and effects. 

* Add another room using the tutorial. 
* Add an enemy using the tutorial. 
    * Give the new enemy some sounds.  
* Add different background music for each of the four rooms. 
* Add a lose sound and background music for the lose screen.
* Add a win sound and background music for the win screen. 
* Add music to the intro screen 
* Remember that music should play continuously but the win and lose sound should only play once. 

## Project 3  

Recreate sound effects from your game sound database game. Pick three different categories of sound effects. You should turn in five variations of each category, totaling 15 sounds. Variations can include different types of vocalizations of a creature, footsteps on different surfaces, or guns shooting different types of bullets. 

Use a combination of the studio and field recording techniques, along with audio manipulation and effects in a DAW. Remember that most sound effects are layered from multiple recording sources. You may use all the techniques we've learned so far whether recording studio techniques or sound design manipulations. You may not use any audio sources except what you record and manipulate. 

In order to match your sound effect to the game you will need to download the youtube clip and import it into Reaper. [Btclod](https://btclod.com) is a good option to do download the video. Create a new track in Reaper and import the video into the track. Turn the volume fader all the way down to not hear the audio, muting mutes the video as well as the audio. 

Duplicate [this Air Table base](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invhJnHYWv0A3CnLW&inviteToken=4a50a52c1e144b4c59274f64f2935928630646b578e945c97f95cd495553613f&utm_source=email) to create your assets list. Fill out the base for each of your sounds. Come up with a naming convention and use it for all your effects. For instance, an ambience might start with AMB and a creature might start with CRE. Write a few sentences for each sound effect type describing what about about this object is influencing your sound design decisions. 

Rubric: 

* 30 points for creating 5 sounds of each type. Each sound is 6 points.
* 10 points for filling out the spreadsheet with the information needed to create the sounds.

Total - 40 points
