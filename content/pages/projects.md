## Project 1

Add sounds to 5 GameObjects in pyramid tutorial project. Move them with the scripts you already had and listen to how the doppler effect works.

## Project 2

Use sounds freesound.org to replace the sounds of the FPS project. You may need to edit the sounds from freesound, or manipulate them. Experiment with filters and effects. 

* Add another room using the tutorial. 
* Add an enemy using the tutorial. 
    * Give the new enemy some sounds.  
* Add different background music for each of the four rooms. 
* Add a lose sound and background music for the lose screen.
* Add a win sound and background music for the win screen. 
* Add music to the intro screen 
* Remember that music should play continuously but the win and lose sound should only play once. 

## Project 3  

Create your own sound effects including, guns, vehicles, creature sounds, footsteps or something of your choosing. Write a few sentences for each sound effect type describing what about about this object is influencing your sound design decisions.  Use a combination of the studio and field recording techniques, along with audio manipulation and effects in a DAW. Remember that most sound effects are layered from multiple recording sources. 
   
You should turn in five variations of each category, totaling 15 sounds. Variations can include different types of vocalizations of a creature, footsteps on different surfaces, or guns shooting different types of bullets. Whatever it is, be sure to describe it well. 

Create a spreadsheet containing a list of all the sounds that need to be created, the name of the output file, the status of the progress on the sound, the number of variations needed if any as well as date of the last revision.

You may use all the techniques we've learned so far whether recording studio techniques or sound design manipulations. You may not use any audio sources except what you record and manipulate. 

Come up with a naming convention and use it for all your effects. For instance, an ambience might start with AMB and a creature might start with CRE.
