## Understanding Animations 

First open the animation window by going to window -> animation -> animation. Then add it to the dock next to the console window. 

Next create a cube and reset the transform so it's in the center of the scene. Create three more cubes to make a sign. Add a material to each cube to give the sign some color. 

Select the sign and create a new animation clip. Create a folder inside your assets folder and name it "sign squeak". Now add the transition properties of position and rotation to the animation. Click on record mode then put the timeline on 10 seconds. Then move the sign so that it's swinging forward. Move the timeline to 30 seconds and move the sign so it swings backwards. Go to 40 seconds and copy and paste the first two keyframes from the start to this point.
